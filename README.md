# Currency-Detection
Currency recognition is the process of detecting the patterns of currencies by comparing them to the databases. In an uncontrolled environment, currency recognition is a challenging task. Since it may lead to a lack of image due to constant varying state. In the case of automated currency recognition, the identification of the value of coins and cash is a quite tough task for many applications.

# Step 1: Load the input currency image
# Step 2 Perform preprocessing technique over image
# Step 3: Detect the color of currency image
# Step 4: If the color of the currency image was detected then get the currency type
# Step 5: Perform segmentation based on type
# Step 6: Perform pattern matching with existing patterns
# Step 7: If pattern matched then obtain the currency value
# Step 8: Execute the currency value of input image as output
